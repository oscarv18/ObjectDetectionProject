## ObjectDetectionProject

The inspiration for this project comes from the underutilization of rail to transport cargo. Of the 1.6 million railcars within the U.S., over 900,000 of them idle for ~23 hours in railyards per journey. This is an enormous issues considering that transporting cargo via rail reduces greenhouse gas emissions by up to 75% when compared to trucking. 

In conjunction with Jie Gao (jake225588), David VanderSloot (David-VanderSloot), Izaan Shaikh (shaikhiz), Rohit Samandur (rohitsamandur), we will be working on constructing a real time object detection system to be used on locomotives in railyards to get railcars on the tracks they need to be on to reduce idle time and improve transportation speeds.
